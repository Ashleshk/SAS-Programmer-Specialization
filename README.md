# SAS-Programmer-Specialization

 ## About this Professional Certificate 
 When you complete the SAS® Base Programming courses, you will have demonstrated skills in manipulating and transforming data, combining SAS data sets, creating basic detail and summary reports using SAS procedures and identifying and correcting data, syntax and programming logic errors. These skills prepare you for the SAS® Base Programmer certification exam.  
 
 ## Applied Learning Project 
 In the last course of this specialization, you complete projects that demonstrate your knowledge of SAS programming. In the first project, you write programs for each stage of the SAS programming process to analyze passenger claims at United States airports. In the second project, you use your knowledge of the data preparation stage to write programs that restructure world tourism data.

## Courses
1. **Getting Started with SAS Programming**
* **About this Course**
    * This course is for users who want to learn how to write SAS programs to access, explore, prepare, and analyze data. It is the entry point to learning SAS programming for data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It is a prerequisite to many other SAS courses.
    * By the end of this course, you will know how to use SAS Studio to write and submit SAS programs that access SAS, Microsoft Excel, and text data. You will know how to explore and validate data, prepare data by subsetting rows and computing new columns, analyze and report on data, export data and results to other formats, use SQL in SAS to query and join tables.
* **Prerequisites:**
